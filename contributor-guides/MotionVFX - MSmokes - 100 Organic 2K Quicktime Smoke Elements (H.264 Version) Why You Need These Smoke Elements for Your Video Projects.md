## What are MSmokes?
 
MSmokes are organic smoke elements that are captured in real life and then processed and optimized for video editing. They are delivered in Quicktime format with H.264 compression, which means they are compatible with most video editing software such as Final Cut Pro X, Apple Motion, Adobe Premiere Pro, After Effects, Nuke, Smoke, etc.
 
MSmokes are pre-keyed, which means they have a transparent background and can be easily overlaid on top of your footage. You can also adjust their opacity, color, scale, position, rotation, and blend mode to suit your needs.
 
MSmokes come in different shapes and sizes, from subtle wisps to thick clouds. You can use them to create realistic smoke effects such as fire, explosions, fog, steam, dust, etc. You can also use them to create abstract and artistic effects such as smoke trails, patterns, textures, etc.

## Tips on how to make the most of MSmokes
 
Here are some tips on how to make the most of MSmokes in your video projects:

- Use different blend modes such as screen, add, overlay, multiply, etc. to create different effects with MSmokes. For example, screen mode will make the smoke brighter and more transparent, while multiply mode will make it darker and more opaque.
- Use color correction tools such as hue/saturation, curves, levels, etc. to change the color and tone of MSmokes. For example, you can make the smoke more blue or red to match the mood of your scene.
- Use masks and keyframes to control the visibility and movement of MSmokes. For example, you can use a mask to hide or reveal parts of the smoke or use keyframes to animate the smoke across the screen.
- Use multiple MSmoke files together to create more complex and realistic effects. For example, you can combine different shapes and sizes of smoke elements to create a fire or an explosion.
- Use other video effects such as blur, glow, distortion, etc. to enhance MSmokes. For example, you can add some blur or glow to make the smoke more soft or bright.
