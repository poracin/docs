The Advanced Scan mode is more thorough and can recover files that have been overwritten or damaged. It can also scan for deleted partitions and restore them. However, this mode takes longer and requires more disk space.
 
The Guided Scan mode is a wizard that guides you through the recovery process step by step. It asks you some questions about the type, location and date of the files you want to recover and then performs the appropriate scan.
 
The Email Recovery mode is a special feature that can recover lost or deleted emails from the most popular mail applications, such as Microsoft Outlook[^1^] [^4^]. It tries to read the data stored in the email client's cache file in this case.
 
For this example, we will use the Quick Scan mode to recover some photos that we deleted from our camera. We connect our camera to our computer via USB and select it as the scan location. Then we click on the Start Scan button.
 
## Step 3: Preview and recover your files
 
Once the scan is complete, ParetoLogic Data Recovery will show you a list of all the files that it found. You can sort them by name, size, type or date. You can also use the search box to find a specific file by name or text.
 
To preview a file, just click on it and it will show you a thumbnail image or a text snippet. You can also double-click on it to open it with its default application. This way, you can check if the file is intact and what you are looking for.
 
To recover a file, just check the box next to it and click on the Recover button. You will be asked to choose a destination folder where you want to save the recovered file. You can also rename the file if you want. Make sure you do not save the file to the same location where it was deleted from, as this may overwrite it and make it unrecoverable.
 
You can select multiple files at once by holding down the Ctrl key while clicking on them. You can also select all files by checking the box next to Name at the top of the list.
 
After recovering your files, you can close ParetoLogic Data Recovery or perform another scan if you want.
