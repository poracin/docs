One of the highlights of Masquerade is the contrast between the two characters played by Lee Byung-hun. King Gwanghae is a ruthless and paranoid ruler who has alienated his subjects and his court with his harsh policies and violent temper. He lives in constant fear of being killed by his enemies and trusts no one. Ha-seon is a humble and cheerful peasant who makes a living by performing comic skits for the common people. He has a good heart and a sense of humor, but he is also naive and ignorant about the affairs of the state.
 
When Ha-seon is hired by the king's loyal councilor Heo Kyun to impersonate the king while he recovers from a poisoning attempt, he faces a steep learning curve. He has to memorize the names and faces of the ministers, follow the etiquette and protocol of the palace, and deal with the complex and dangerous political situation. He also has to pretend to be married to the queen, who is unaware of the switch and has a strained relationship with the real king.

As Ha-seon spends more time as the king, he begins to develop his own vision and style of leadership. He listens to the grievances of the people, reforms the corrupt and oppressive system, and makes peace with the neighboring countries. He also grows closer to the queen, who is surprised and touched by his kindness and affection. However, his actions also attract the attention and suspicion of those who want to overthrow or kill the king. Ha-seon soon realizes that being the king is not only a privilege but also a burden and a risk.
