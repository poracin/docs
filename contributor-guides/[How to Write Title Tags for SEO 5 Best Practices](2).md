Once you have downloaded the map files, you need to extract them using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You should see several folders with names like "building", "map", "phoneme", "poi", and "speedcam". These are the different types of map data that Igo8 uses.
 
## Step 2: Install Igo8 Maps on a SD Card
 
The next step is to install the Igo8 maps on a SD card that you can use on your device. You need to format the SD card first using FAT32 file system. Then, you need to copy the Igo8 software folder and the map folders to the root of the SD card. The Igo8 software folder contains the executable file "iGO8.exe" and other files that are necessary for running the program. You can download the Igo8 software from some of the sources mentioned above or from other websites.
 
After copying the files, you need to set the GPS path on your device to point to the "iGO8.exe" file on the SD card. This may vary depending on your device model and settings, but usually you can find it under the navigation or GPS menu. You may also need to adjust some other settings, such as screen resolution, sound volume, language, etc., according to your preferences.
 
## Step 3: Enjoy Your Updated Igo8 Maps
 
Once you have completed the installation process, you can insert the SD card into your device and launch the Igo8 program. You should see the updated maps on your screen and be able to use them for navigation. You can also check the map version and date by tapping on the "More" button and then on "About".
