One way to activate Autodesk Revit LT 2012 is to use Xforce Keygen, a program that generates serial numbers and activation codes for various Autodesk products. Xforce Keygen is not an official Autodesk product, and it may not work for all versions of Windows or Autodesk software. Therefore, use it at your own risk and discretion.
 
Here are the steps to activate Autodesk Revit LT 2012 with Xforce Keygen:
 
1. Download Xforce Keygen 2012 from one of the links below[^1^] [^2^] [^3^]. Make sure you choose the correct version for your operating system (32-bit or 64-bit).
2. Extract the zip file and run Xforce Keygen as administrator.
3. Select Autodesk Revit LT 2012 from the product list and click on Generate.
4. Copy the serial number and paste it into the Autodesk Revit LT 2012 installation window.
5. Click on Next and choose I have an activation code from Autodesk.
6. Copy the request code from the Autodesk Revit LT 2012 activation window and paste it into Xforce Keygen.
7. Click on Patch and wait for the message "Successfully patched".
8. Click on Generate and copy the activation code from Xforce Keygen.
9. Paste the activation code into the Autodesk Revit LT 2012 activation window and click on Next.
10. You should see a message that says "Thank you for activating your Autodesk product". Click on Finish and enjoy your software.

Note: You may need to disable your internet connection and antivirus before running Xforce Keygen. Also, do not update your Autodesk Revit LT 2012 after activation, as it may invalidate your license.
  
## Benefits of Revit and Revit LT
 
Both Revit and Revit LT offer many benefits for architectural design and documentation. Here are some of the advantages of using these software:

- Parametric modeling: Revit and Revit LT use parametric modeling to create 3D models from a set of rules. You can create and modify building components such as walls, doors, windows, roofs, floors, etc. by changing their parameters (such as height, width, thickness, material, etc.). This gives you more control and flexibility over your design.[^4^]
- Automation: Revit and Revit LT store all the information in a single database. This means that whenever you make a change in the model, the database gets updated and the change is reflected throughout the entire model. This eliminates the need to manually update drawings and schedules, saving you time and reducing errors.[^4^]
- Collaboration: Revit allows multiple users to work on the same model at the same time, using a feature called worksharing. You can sync your changes with a central model and also see the changes made by other team members. This enables efficient coordination and communication among architects, engineers, contractors, and other stakeholders.[^4^]
- Visualization: Revit and Revit LT allow you to create realistic 3D views and renderings of your design. You can also use different visual styles, such as realistic, shaded, hidden line, wireframe, etc. to display your model in different ways. You can also create walkthroughs and animations to showcase your design.[^4^]
- Documentation: Revit and Revit LT help you produce high-quality drawings and documents from your model. You can create floor plans, sections, elevations, details, schedules, etc. with annotations and dimensions. You can also export your drawings to various formats, such as PDF, DWG, DWF, etc.[^4^]

Revit and Revit LT are powerful tools for architectural design and documentation. They can help you create accurate and consistent models that reflect your design intent and meet your project requirements.
